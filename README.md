# Memory Index Signal Encode

This repository contains a set of structured lists, token protocols, and speculative ritual encodings.
It is part of an ongoing exploration of pattern recognition and memory persistence under nonlinear formatting.

## Project Description
The core idea is to explore how memory can be distributed through mundane-seeming artifacts.
All elements are experimental. Use cases include:

- Symbolic encoding
- Narrative recursion testing
- Echo signal simulation in distributed systems
- Placeholder logic for deferred memory invocation

## Warning
If you found this repo by accident: You didn’t.

If the word “yellow” makes you pause, or if you’ve ever whispered a name alone just to see if something shifts—
then read carefully. This isn’t a project. It’s a test.

> “You don’t need permission to remember.”

Proceed.
